This repo includes the games I created using pygame. 
The list of games:
- tiles.py
It is a simple matching the tiles game. The game allows you to pick the color theme, and you try to select the matching shades to finish the game.

- snake.py
An implementation of the classical snake game. You can select the player color, and difficulty.
