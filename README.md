This repo includes the games I created using pygame. 

The list of games:  
_- tiles.py_  
  It is a simple matching the tiles game. The game allows you to pick the color theme, and you try to select the matching shades to finish the game.

_- snake.py_  
An implementation of the classical snake game. You can select the player color, and difficulty.
